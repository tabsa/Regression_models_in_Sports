# Regression models applied to Sport statistics
This repository explains all my projects on supervisesd learning for predicting sport statistics. I have programmed regression models in python and have built Dashboard using Streamlit for data visualization.

##  Background
Material used to build this repository:
- Article on linear regression models to predict NBA data, available [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/learn-linear-regression-using-scikit-learn-and-nba-data-data-science-with-sports-9908b0f6a031);
